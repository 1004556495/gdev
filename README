Gdev uses PathScale's PSCNV open-source driver with some extension
as a background implementation of a GPU device driver. It currently
supports most of NVIDIA's GPU architectures, including Fermi (nvc0). 
Gdev also plans to use Nouveau as another background implementation
given that some Linux distros install Nouveau by default recently.
As Gdev doesn't change any interface provided by PSCNV or Nouveau,
the X window system and its compiz can accelerate on GPUs with Gdev.
However, this requires users to additionally install LIBDRM and DDX.
See https://github.com/pathscale/ for PSCNV and 
http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/InstallNouveau for Nouveau.
To install Gdev device driver, follow the instructions below.
Let $(TOPDIR) be the top working directory, henceforth.

1. envytools

envytools provides a set of tools that assemble/disassemble firmware
code, GPU code, and macro code. It also provides tools to generate
header files that include GPU command definitions.
Gdev requires envytools to compile fermi firmware code.

$ cd $(TOPDIR)
$ git clone git://github.com/pathscale/envytools.git
$ cd envytools
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. # may require you to install some packages on your distro
$ make
$ sudo make install # will install tools to /usr/local/{bin,lib}

2. Gdev runtime

There are two instances of Gdev runtime that users can choose:
(i) user-space runtime and (ii) kernel-space runtime.
The user-space runtime provides all compute functions in user-space,
while the kernel-space runtime lives in the OS and user-space programs
need to use the ioctl system call to use their functions. The following
assume user-space runtime.

$ cd $(TOPDIR)/runtime
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cp gdev_nvidia_nvc0.o Makefile . # copy missing files
$ ../configure --runtime=user # --runtime=kernel will use kernel-space
$ make
$ sudo make install

3. Gdev device driver

$ cd $(TOPDIR)/driver
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ../configure
$ cp gdev_nvidia_nvc0.o . # copy missing files
$ make
$ sudo init 3
$ cd $(TOPDIR)/driver/build
$ sudo make install

4. Test

$ cd $(TOPDIR)/tests/user/matrixadd
$ make
$ sudo ./user_test 3 # a[3] + b[3] = c[3]
